Hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:

	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>

Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed with this command:

	git branch -m <name>
